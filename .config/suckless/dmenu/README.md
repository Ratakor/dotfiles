# Ratakor's dmenu

Fork of Luke Smith's dmenu.

Extra stuff added to vanilla dmenu:

- reads Xresources (ergo pywal compatible)
- alpha patch, which importantly allows this build to be embedded in transparent st
- can view color characters like emoji
- `-P` for password mode: hide user input
- `-r` to reject non-matching input
- dmenu options are mouse clickable
- center with -c
- case insensitive so case sensitive with -i
- dracula theme
- borders

- **not builtin**: border and fade with picom

## Installation

```
# make clean install
```
