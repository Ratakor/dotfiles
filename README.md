## Installation
I follow the [.local convention](https://gist.github.com/Earnestly/84cf9670b7e11ae2eac6f753910efebe)
to a point that I have just one dotfile in $HOME (yes no .ssh, .dbus or .pki)
so you'll need to tweak the Makefile if you don't. Also if you're not using
Parabola OpenRC you will probably need to edit .local/share/packages according
to your distro.

DO NOT TRY TO INSTALL if it's not a fresh install and you don't know what you're doing.

	$ git clone https://github.com/ratakor/dotfiles.git
	$ cd dotfiles/.local
	$ make
