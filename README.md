## Disclaimer
**This branch is not supposed to be installed, please look at master branch instead.**

## Installation
I follow the [.local
convention](https://gist.github.com/Earnestly/84cf9670b7e11ae2eac6f753910efebe)
so you'll need to tweak the Makefile if you don't. Also if you're not using
Artix OpenRC you will probably need to edit .local/share/packages/packages
according to your distro. Also you'll need Arch repos if you're using Artix.

DO NOT TRY TO INSTALL if it's not a fresh install and you don't know what you're doing.

	$ git clone -b artix https://git.ratakor.com/dotfiles.git
	$ cd dotfiles/.local
	$ make
